## Hi there! I'm Mark Tower

I'm an artist and illustrator living in Lubbock, TX. Iâ€™ve always been painting or drawing for as long as long as I remember. Art has been an anchor for keeping an ever renewing sense of wonder and curiosity. I tend to paint surreal, colorful landscape and nature, blending my imagination with reality.

In the background I have been working on a worldbuilding project for years. In time I hope to share some of that here.
