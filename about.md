## Hi there!

 I'm Mark Tower and I'm an artist and illustrator located in Lubbock, TX. Iâ€™ve always been painting or drawing for as long as long as I remember. Art has been an anchor for keeping an ever renewing sense of wonder and curiosity. I like to paint surreal, colorful landscapes and nature, blending my imagination with reality.

Thanks for stopping by!
